Hi there, it's great to meet you! :)

I'm Daniel Steinfeld, a researcher at the GVZ Gebäudeversicherung Kanton Zürich, specializing in weather and climate risks. My work focuses on various projects related to natural hazards and sustainability.

A bit about my background: I studied physics and geosciences, and hold a Masters in Climate Sciences from the University of Bern and a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from ETH Zurich. My research focuses on atmospheric and climate dynamics, analyzing physical processes that govern large-scale circulation and high-impact weather events like atmospheric blocking and windstorms. In the past, I've worked as a PostDoc at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern, and I also spent two years as a Risk Modeler for a Swiss insurance company.

In my free time, you can find me either on a river kayaking or skiing and hiking in the mountains.
